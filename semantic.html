            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> I love playing the violin ever since I was grade 8. If I am down, I can play it with pieces and songs to cheer myself up. I can always make time for it even if it is just like 30 or 60 minutes
            This is why I love this hobby because of its availabality, usefullness, and feelings it can convey.</p>

            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>I like the hobby because I can do it if I have free time and the hobby is one of the only things I enjoy. I love playing at weddings because I can play my hobby and make the atmosphere more lively and romantic.

            <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
            <p id="main"> I wanna improve at playing the violin for someone nyehehehe.<br></br>
                But an actual fun fact is that the oldest or one of the first violins sell for millions and millions of money or dollars, and there are only 20 remaining in the world.</p>
